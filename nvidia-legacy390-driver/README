This is the proprietary binary video driver from NVidia for the XLibre
X-server. This package does not include the kernel modules - they are
a part of the nvidia-legacy390-kernel package.

Installing the 32-bit compatibility libraries is available:
if desired, do:
  COMPAT32="yes" ./nvidia-legacy390-driver.SlackBuild

This script now gives the option of installing the nvidia-persistenced
daemon.  PLEASE read README.nvidia-persistenced before building with
persistenced.

Several useful utilities are included: nvidia-xsettings, nvidia-smi,
and nvidia-settings.  Please refer to the Nvidia documentation and man
pages for details and usage.

For CUDA/OpenCL to work after reboot, and for utilites such as
nvidia-smi, you might need to include the following line in your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

# Create missing nvidia device nodes after reboot
if [ -x /usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe ]; then
  /usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe -c 0 -u
fi

NOTES:
This nvidia-legacy390-driver DOES NOT conflict with open source drivers
and libraries of XLibre, if proper /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf
file, which is included, is installed.

You DON'T need to blacklist nouveau in /etc/modprobe.d/*. If there is a file
that contains a line 'blacklist nouveau', remove it.

Moreover, you can choose nvidia or nouveau kernel/X drivers at boot time
by blacklisting unneeded modules and loading an initrd image with necesssary
ones. The nvidia-kernel package installs /usr/sbin/nvidia-prepare-boot script
and runs it right at installation, although you can run it any time as root
to regenerate /boot/initrd-${KERNEL}.img (without nouveau and nvidia kernel modules).
Additionally, it creates an /etc/lilo.conf.nvidia-${KERNEL} snippet that looks like this:

# Linux bootable partition config begins
image = /boot/vmlinuz-6.12.6
  root = /dev/sda9
  label = Linux-6.12.6-nvi
  read-only  # Partitions should be mounted read-only for checking
  initrd = /boot/initrd-6.12.6.img
  append = " module_blacklist=nouveau nvidia_drm.modeset=1"
# Linux bootable partition config ends
# Linux bootable partition config begins
image = /boot/vmlinuz-6.12.6
  root = /dev/sda9
  label = Linux-6.12.6-nou
  read-only  # Partitions should be mounted read-only for checking
  initrd = /boot/initrd-6.12.6.img
  append = " module_blacklist=nvidia,nvidia_drm,nvidia_uvm,nvidia_modeset"
# Linux bootable partition config ends

You can add it (edited if you like) to /etc/lilo.conf to choose at boot
which drivers to use. This adds an additional safety margin in case
something goes wrong after an upgrade or an experiment. If you use, say,
GRUB2 instead of LILO, you can take kernel options from here to use
in grub.cfg.

Tested with linux kernels up to 6.17.6.
